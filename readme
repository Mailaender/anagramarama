Anagramarama

How to compile/install it?

The easiest current solution is to use cmake with a command like:

cmake . && make && sudo make install

The game need SDL and SDL_mixer installed. It has optional support for libgamerzilla. The game can run without installing it if you want to test it.

The older platform makefiles are still included at the moment. They have not been tested. They still build the game as "ag" instead of "anagramarama".
